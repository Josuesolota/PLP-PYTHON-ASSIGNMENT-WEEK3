# Discount Calculator

This project is a simple Python program that calculates the final price of an item after a discount is applied. The program checks if the discount is 20% or more; if so, it applies the discount. Otherwise, the original price is returned.

## Features

- **Discount Calculation:** The `calculate_discount` function takes the original price and a discount percentage as input and returns the final price.
- **Conditional Logic:** The program only applies the discount if the specified percentage is 20% or higher, ensuring the user gets a good deal.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Prompts the user for price and discount information and displays the final price in a clear, easy-to-read format.

## How to Use

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
  https://github.com/Josuesolota/PLP-PYTHON-ASSIGNMENT-WEEK3.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```
3.  Run the Python script:
    ```bash
    PLP-PYTHON-WEEK3
    ```
    Enter the original price of the item: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 25


If the discount is applied, the output will be:

Final price after a 25.00% discount: $75.00


If the discount is not applied (less than 20%), the output will be:

Enter the original price of the item: 100
Enter the discount percentage: 15
No discount applied. The price remains: $100.00
